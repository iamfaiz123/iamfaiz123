**Senior Rust Engineer | WASM AI Practitioner | Blockchain Developer**

I am a Senior Software Engineer with **6+ years of dedicated experience in the Rust ecosystem**. I specialize in building high-performance distributed backends, WASM-based AI implementations, and secure blockchain architecture.

I am an **immediate joiner** looking for opportunities to leverage my deep expertise in systems programming and concurrency to build the next generation of scalable applications.

> **Note on GitHub:** My primary impact is reflected in the proprietary systems, internal libraries, and high-performance tooling I develop for my employers. I prioritize delivering production value over public contribution metrics.

## What can I offer?

* **6+ Years Rust Experience:** Deep mastery of `Tokio`, `Actix-web`, `Diesel`, and low-level concurrency.
* **WASM & AI:** Specialized in deploying AI workloads to the edge and browser via WebAssembly.
* **Blockchain & DeFi:** Professional experience with `Radix` and `Scrypto` for smart contract development.
* **Distributed Systems:** Expert in `gRPC`, `REST`, `WebSockets`, `Kafka`, and `Micro-services`.
* **Database Engineering:** Proficiency in `PostgreSQL`, `Redis`, and `MongoDB`.
* **Leadership:** 5+ years of `Agile` and `Scrum` leadership, driving `TDD` and team excellence.
* **Full-Stack Capability:** Professional experience with `Python (FastAPI)`, `React`, and `Docker/AWS` infrastructure.
* **Personal:** Professional English, avid biker, traveler, and hobbyist gamer.

## Demo

Most of my work is proprietary and belongs to my employers. However, I maintain select open-source contributions:

1.  [**Easy Algolia**](https://crates.io/crates/EasyAlgolia): A high-level Rust crate for simplified data ingestion and search indexing. This project demonstrates my standards for API design, performance, and testing.

## What can you offer me?

* **Steady Income:** Fair compensation for senior-level technical expertise.
* **Technical Growth:** Opportunity to work with WASM, AI, and Blockchain specialists.
* **Knowledge Sharing:** A culture that supports technical blogging and community talks.
* **International Scope:** Experience building products for a global market.
* **High-Caliber Team:** A collaborative environment with expert engineers.
